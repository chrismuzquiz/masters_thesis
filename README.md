# EMOTION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSES WITH GAUSSIAN PROCESS MULTI-TASK KERNELS

## Abstract:
Natural language processing (NLP) systems analyze language to extract linguistic information and build representations from data. The tasks of emotion and sentiment analyses are among many currently being studied and will be addressed in this thesis. The first half of this paper is the theoretical development of Gaussian processes, kernel functions, multi-task learning, string processing in NLP, and methods of model assessment and selection. The objective of the latter half is to implement Gaussian process models to predict scores of affect on a dataset containing annotated headlines. We construct single-task models equipped with the string, polynomial, and Matern kernels and use compound kernels produced by means of forward stepwise selection. We then build multi-task models and employ kernels obtained under the linear model of coregionalization assumption. Lastly, we analyze the performance of our models using cross-validation and test set prediction assessment metrics.
